Project Title: Home Price Prediction and Analysis

Objective: Develop a predictive model to predict home prices based on different features and analyze real estate market trends. The project will assist you in investigating significant factors influencing home prices, implementing machine learning algorithms, and interpreting the outcomes.

Project Steps:
1. Problem Definition and Data Collection:
Goal: To predict home prices from different features like location, size, number of bedrooms, age of the house, etc.

Data Source:

Option 1: Public datasets like the Kaggle Housing Price Dataset.

Option 2: Web scrape real estate data via APIs (e.g., Zillow API) or scrape publicly available listings.

Option 3: Utilize real estate data from FRED or other similar sources.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handle missing values: Impute or remove rows/columns with missing values depending on the distribution.

Categorical Variables: Transform categorical variables (e.g., neighborhood, house type) into numeric values using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Outliers: Detect and manage outliers based on statistical techniques or domain expertise.

Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize numerical features (e.g., size, price) where necessary.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Univariate analysis: Plot distributions of important features (e.g., price, size, bedrooms) on histograms, box plots, and density plots.

Bivariate analysis: Examine interactions between independent variables and the target variable (price). Utilize scatter plots, correlation matrices, and heatmaps to look at the strength of interactions.

Multivariate analysis: Examine how various variables interact (e.g., how location, size, and year built influence home price).

Key Insights to investigate:

Correlation between features and the target (price).

Trends according to location, house type, or age.

Price distribution in various neighborhoods.

4. Feature Engineering:
Develop new features which may enhance the prediction capability of the model:

Age of the house (current year - year constructed).

Price per square meter.

Distance from city center or closest schools.

Number of bathrooms and garages.

5. Model Building:
Regression Models:

Linear Regression: Begin with a base model to learn linear relations.

Random Forest Regression: Investigate a tree-based approach to identify non-linear relationships and enhance performance.

XGBoost or LightGBM: For more sophisticated boosting techniques.

Time Series Models (Optional):

In case your data extends over years, use ARIMA or similar time-series models to identify temporal trends.

6. Model Evaluation:
Utilize cross-validation to measure the performance of the model.

Compare models based on measures such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), R-squared, MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and MSE (Mean Squared Error).

Use SHAP values or tree model feature importance to explain feature contribution to home prices.

7. Model Tuning and Optimization:
Apply GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to fine-tune model performance.

For tree models, optimize hyperparameters such as max_depth, learning_rate, and n_estimators.

For linear models, optimize the regularization parameter (e.g., alpha for Ridge or Lasso).

8. Results Interpretation:
Offer insights based on model outcomes:

Which features have the most impact on price prediction?

Are there any noticeable trends or patterns based on location, size, or house age?

Which model performed the best, and why?

9. Model Deployment (Optional):
Create a streamlit app or Flask API to allow users to input home features (e.g., location, size, bedrooms) and get a price prediction.

Deploy your model using Heroku or AWS to make it accessible online.
